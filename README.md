# Lung X-ray Anomaly Detection

This project aims to develop an application to detect abnormalities in lung X-ray images. It uses various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist in the identification of lung diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer, by highlighting suspicious regions within X-ray images.

## Project Objectives
- **Automated Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal patterns in lung X-rays, such as nodules, masses, or any irregular formations that might indicate potential health issues.
- **Image Processing Techniques**: Apply various preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of X-ray images for accurate analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Train a machine learning model to classify or segment abnormalities based on preprocessed X-ray images.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains X-ray image datasets.
- **src/**: Contains code files for data preprocessing, model training, and testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, image preprocessing steps, and model experimentation.
- **models/**: Stores trained models and model weights.
- **results/**: Stores output images, model predictions, and evaluation metrics.

## Planned Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect a dataset of lung X-ray images and perform preprocessing steps such as resizing, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement.
2. **Image Processing Techniques**: Use techniques like histogram equalization, edge detection, and segmentation to highlight suspicious areas in the images.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Train a machine learning model to detect anomalies. Models considered include CNN-based architectures and possibly transfer learning approaches for higher accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Generate and save visual representations of detected anomalies on X-ray images.

## Data Source
We will use publicly available datasets, such as the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset or similar, to build and validate the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
